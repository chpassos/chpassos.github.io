I welcome you all to my GitHub page!
My name is Carlos, I am 22 yo and I live in São Paulo since birth.

I am a biology undergrad student at University of São Paulo and I am that kind of person that is amazed by almost everything at the same time, from human evolution to genetic architecture of complex traits. Also, I always had general interests in molecular evolution.

I am part of the Evolutionary Genetics Laboratory, and under supervision of Prof. Dr. Diogo Meyer and Dra. Kelly Nunes, we will focus in trying to find signatures of natural selection on human X chromosome in different time scales.

Feel free to explore my page or contact me :)
