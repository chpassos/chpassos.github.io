Hi to all! Welcome to my GitHub page!

My name is Carlos, I am 22 yo and I live in São Paulo

Currently a Biology undergrad student at University of São Paulo, I am that kind of person that is amazed by almost everything at the same time, from human evolution to genetic architecture of complex traits. Also, I always had general interests in molecular evolution.

I am part of the [Laboratory of Evolutionary Genetics](http://www.ib.usp.br/genevol/), and under supervision of Prof. Dr. Diogo Meyer and Dra. Kelly Nunes, we will focus in trying to find signatures of natural selection on human X chromosome in different time scales.

This page is a working in progress. Feel free to explore my page or contact me :)
