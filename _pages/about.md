Hi to all! Welcome to my GitHub page!

My name is Carlos, I am 22 years old and I live in São Paulo

Currently a Biology undergrad student at University of São Paulo, I am that kind of person that is amazed by a lot of things at the same time. For example, from human evolution to genetic architecture of complex traits. Also, I always had general interests in molecular evolution.

I am part of the [Laboratory of Evolutionary Genetics](http://www.ib.usp.br/genevol/), and for my thesis I will look for signatures of natural selection on human X chromosome in different time scales.

This page is for you to know me and to know the work that I will be doing in the upcoming years. This page will often be updated

Feel free to explore my page or contact me :)
